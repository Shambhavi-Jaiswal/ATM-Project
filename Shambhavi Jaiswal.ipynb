ATM Machine Using Python Classes and Objects
This program simulates how the ATM (Automatic Teller Machine) of The XYZ Bank works. Therefore, the program does the following basic ATM requirements:

1. Account creation
2. Check Account Details
3. Check Balance
4. Deposit Amount
5. Withdraw Amount
6. Exit with a transaction receipt
Here, I have created one ATM Class which has following methods:

init: to create instance of an object
Account Details: to check details of account, it will ask for the pin and after verifying your pin, it will show your Account Details
Deposit: to deposit the money in account, it will ask for pin and after verifying your pin, it will add money to you Account
Withdraw: to debit the money from the account, it will ask for pin and after verifying you pin, it will let you withdraw the money from your Account
Check_Balance: it will ask for your pin and after checking your pin, it will display the details of your Account balance
Transaction: it will show you final details of Account after transaction is completed
